# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the Inventory Management Application, which allows users to manage items via a web interface (Vue.js) and mobile app (React Native), backed by an Express.js API and MongoDB database.

### 1.2 Scope
The application provides full CRUD functionality for inventory items. Users can add, edit, view, and delete items from a centralized inventory system using both web and mobile interfaces.

### 1.3 Intended Audience
- Developers and QA engineers
- Project managers
- Stakeholders

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
This system is a full-stack application that interacts with a cloud-hosted MongoDB database through a RESTful Express.js API. It includes separate frontends for web and mobile platforms.

### 2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
- **Admin/User**: Can view, create, edit, and delete inventory items.

### 2.3 Operating Environment
- Web: Vue.js with Vite, running in modern browsers
- Mobile: React Native app built with Expo
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js, connected to MongoDB Atlas

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- The system shall respond to API requests within 500ms on average.
- The mobile and web UIs shall be responsive and user-friendly.
- The backend must use environment variables for secrets/configuration.
- The system must handle 10+ concurrent users without error.

---

## 5. Assumptions and Constraints

- MongoDB Atlas is used as the database backend.
- Only one model, `Item`, is supported at this time.
