# Inventory App Design Document - Part 0: Introduction

## Introduction

The Inventory App is a cross-platform application designed as a reusable template for managing inventories across domains such as warehouses, retail stores, and personal collections. It offers a user-friendly interface for adding, viewing, editing, and deleting inventory items, with support for both web and mobile platforms. Built with a modern tech stack, the app ensures scalability, maintainability, and extensibility. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture, data models, API design, frontend designs for web (Vue.js) and mobile (React Native, Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android), backend (Express.js, MongoDB), a data flow diagram, and detailed enhancement suggestions to improve functionality, usability, and scalability.

### Goals
- Deliver a modular, reusable inventory management solution.
- Support web (Vue.js) and mobile clients (React Native, with native Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android).
- Provide a robust backend using Express.js and MongoDB.
- Enable extensibility for future features, such as categories and user authentication.

### Project Context
- **Date**: May 26, 2025 (Sprint 2 completed, Day 28 of 181 project days).
- **Styling Update**: The web frontend has transitioned from TailwindCSS to custom PostCSS styles (post-Sprint 2).
- **Navigation Update**: The web frontend uses a single route (`/`) with modals for Add/Edit/View actions, not separate routes as initially planned.
