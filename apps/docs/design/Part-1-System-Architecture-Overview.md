# Inventory App Design Document - Part 1: System Architecture Overview

## 1. System Architecture Overview

### Overview
The Inventory App follows a client-server architecture with a RESTful API, enabling web and mobile clients to interact with a centralized backend. Shared logic ensures consistency across platforms, facilitating seamless data management and synchronization.

### Key Components
- **Web Frontend (Vue.js)**: A single-page application (SPA) using Vue Router and custom PostCSS styles for responsive design.
- **Mobile Frontend (React Native)**: A cross-platform mobile app for iOS and Android, using React Navigation for screen transitions.
- **Native Mobile (Swift for iOS)**: A native iOS app using SwiftUI, leveraging Appleâ€™s ecosystem for performance and integration.
- **Native Mobile (Kotlin for Android)**: A native Android app using Jetpack Compose, incorporating modern Android features like Material Design.
- **Backend (Express.js API)**: A Node.js backend handling CRUD operations, with middleware for CORS, JSON parsing, and error handling.
- **Database (MongoDB)**: A NoSQL database accessed via Mongoose for schema validation and efficient querying.
- **Shared Logic (shared/api.js)**: A unified API client using Axios (for web and React Native), Retrofit (Kotlin), and URLSession (Swift) to ensure consistent API interactions across platforms.

### Scalability Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Deploy the Express.js API across multiple instances behind a load balancer to handle increased traffic.
- **Database Sharding**: Use MongoDB sharding to manage large datasets effectively.
- **Caching**: Integrate Redis to cache frequently accessed data, reducing database load.

### Notes
- The shared logic (`shared/api.js`) ensures consistency in API calls across platforms, reducing code duplication.
- Scalability features like Redis caching are detailed in the **Performance Optimization** enhancement (Part 10, Section 10.9).
